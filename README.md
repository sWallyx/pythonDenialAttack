[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/e96ce6b05b0847c0833a83e2e8ed652a)](https://app.codacy.com/manual/mikelsmartinez/pythonDenialAttack?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=sWallyx/pythonDenialAttack&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Dashboard)

Simple application for a Denial of Service (DOS) made with Python3.

This was purely written for educational researches. Never run such an attack against IP addresses that are not under your control. Never abuse the script to harm anybody. You got your responsibility.

## Requirements
The following modules are required to run the application:
* socket
* random
* sys
* time

Most of them, if not all, come with Python.
